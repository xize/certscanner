# certscanner
A easy to use gui for sigcheck

### what is certscanner?
cert scanner is a utility specially crafted to detect possible indicators of unknown malware.
we do use sigcheck created by Mark Russinovich (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sigcheck)
but we make it easier to check for indicators of compromise.

### how does it work?
the program its self is very easy to use, we include two options quick scan and full scan.
once the user selected the scan option the gui will hide inside the tray bar and keep scanning.
